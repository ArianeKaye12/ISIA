Going into this subject, I’m honestly a mix of curious and a little nervous. I know that system integration and architecture are important in the tech world, but I haven’t had much exposure to them yet. From what I understand so far, it’s all about how different systems, apps, and technologies work together to form a bigger, functioning solution. I expect that this subject will help me understand the bigger picture of how software is planned, structured, and made to work with other systems.
I also expect to learn how different systems communicate with each other. Nowadays, a lot of software needs to connect with other tools, apps, or devices, and I think this subject will help me understand how that’s done through things like APIs. I’m looking forward to doing hands-on activities or projects where we try integrating systems, because that kind of experience will be useful in real jobs after graduation.
I’m expecting this subject to challenge me, but in a good way. I want to walk away with a better understanding of how complex systems are built and how different technologies can be integrated to work as one. I know it won’t be easy, but I’m excited to learn and see how this knowledge can be applied to real projects or maybe even my future job.
